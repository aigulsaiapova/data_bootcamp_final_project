# data_bootcamp_final_project
Final project for the course at NYU Stern Data Bootcamp, spring 2019.

Project Description:

This project will study the interdynamics of the 2009 acquisition of Marvel Entertainment by The Wall Disney Company. Since the time of the merger, Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) productions have been hitting box office records all around the world, while The Walt Disney Company kept growing in size and profitability. According to the most recent news, MCU has become the most profitable movie franchise in the history of cinematography. Disney, at the same time, went on a "shopping spree" to acquire the ABC broadcasting company (1995), Lucasfilm (famous for its production of Star Wars), 20th and 21th Century Fox, FOX Television Studios and Pixar ever since. With these extended capabilities, The Walt Disney Company has formed a massive conglomerate, strongly exhibiting monopolistic behavior. Some [media sources](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/25/how-the-avengers-saved-disneys-movie-business.aspx) claim that the acquisition of Marvel Entertainment is what "saved Disney's movie business" while [others](http://fortune.com/2015/10/08/disney-marvel/) claim the opposite. Therefore, my objective for this project is to disentangle the causal-correllational effect of this merger. Here is how I plan to proceed:

1. Look at the box office data from the dawn to dusk of Marvel Cinematic Universe, marking the date of the acquisition.


2. Examine the review dynamics for the MCU productions by using data on average film ratings and variance in number of reviewers from websites like [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066946827/) (International Movie Database) and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/marvel_cinematic_universe/), widely used for reference by the audience.


3. Screen effect: how many screens on average could display films of the MCU, and whether that had an effect on profitability.


4. Look at the general entertainment trends: what if the popularity of the Marvel content is a consequence of shifting preferences for entertainment rather than the sheer excellence of the franchise?


The project will have two parts: an analytical, programming based assignment presented in this Jupyter Notebook and a separate PowerPoint presentation explaining data points and providing additional reference information.
