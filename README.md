Project Description:

This project is focused on the interdynamics of the 2009 acquisition of Marvel Entertainment by The Wall Disney Company. Since the time of the merger, Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) productions have been hitting box office records all around the world, while The Walt Disney Company kept growing in size and profitability. According to the most recent news, MCU has become the most profitable movie franchise in the history of cinematography. Disney, at the same time, went on a "shopping spree" to acquire the ABC broadcasting company (1995), Lucasfilm (famous for its production of Star Wars), 20th and 21th Century Fox, FOX Television Studios and Pixar ever since. With these extended capabilities, The Walt Disney Company has formed a massive conglomerate, strongly exhibiting monopolistic behavior. Some [media sources](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/25/how-the-avengers-saved-disneys-movie-business.aspx) claim that the acquisition of Marvel Entertainment is what "saved Disney's movie business" while [others](http://fortune.com/2015/10/08/disney-marvel/) claim the opposite. Therefore, my objective for this project is to disentangle the causal-correllational effect of this merger. 

The findings reveal that the cause-correlation effect of the merger is inconclusive, and that further analysis is required.
